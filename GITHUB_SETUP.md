# GitHub Publication Guide

## Publishing Your UYP Basketball App to GitHub

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

The project is already git-initialized and ready for GitHub. Here's what's been prepared:

✅ **Updated .gitignore** - Excludes sensitive files and build outputs
✅ **Created README.md** - Comprehensive project documentation  
✅ **Added .env.example** - Template for environment variables
✅ **Deployment docs** - Contributing guidelines and setup instructions

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository" or the "+" icon
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `uyp-basketball-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Progressive Web App for UYP Basketball League - team and family management platform"
   - **Visibility**: Private (recommended for proprietary code)
   - **Initialize**: Don't check any boxes (repository already has files)

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands in your Replit shell:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/uyp-basketball-app.git

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: UYP Basketball League PWA with Google Calendar integration"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Security Setup

Before publishing, ensure these secrets are NOT in your code:

🔐 **Environment Variables** (add to GitHub Secrets if deploying):
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY` - Your Google Calendar API key  
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Secure session secret

🔐 **Files Already Protected**:
- `.env` files are in .gitignore
- No hardcoded API keys in source code
- Database credentials are environment-based

### Step 5: Repository Setup

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Add Repository Description**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the gear icon next to "About"
   - Add: "Progressive Web App for UYP Basketball League with Google Calendar integration, real-time chat, and multi-profile support"
   - Add topics: `basketball`, `pwa`, `react`, `typescript`, `youth-sports`

2. **Set Up GitHub Pages** (optional for documentation)
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from branch
   - Branch: main, folder: / (root)

3. **Configure Branch Protection**
   - Go to Settings → Branches
   - Add protection rule for main branch
   - Require pull request reviews

### Step 6: Deployment Options

#### Option A: Replit Deployment (Recommended)
- Your app is already running perfectly on Replit
- Use Replit's deployment features for production
- Configure custom domain if needed

#### Option B: External Deployment
If deploying elsewhere, you'll need:
- PostgreSQL database (Neon, Supabase, etc.)
- Environment variables configuration
- Node.js hosting (Vercel, Railway, Render, etc.)

### Step 7: Team Collaboration

For team development:

1. **Add Collaborators**
   - Go to Settings → Collaborators
   - Add team members with appropriate permissions

2. **Set Up Issue Templates**
   - Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
   - Add bug report and feature request templates

3. **Configure Pull Request Template**
   - Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - Include checklist for testing and documentation

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Before Publishing**:
- Remove any hardcoded API keys or secrets
- Test the app thoroughly in demo mode
- Verify all Google Calendar integration works
- Ensure PWA installation works on iOS

✅ **What's Ready**:
- Complete Google Calendar integration with 100+ real events
- Full demo mode with realistic data
- PWA setup for iOS installation
- Comprehensive trophies and badges system
- Real-time team chat functionality

### Repository Structure

Your published repository will include:
```

├── attached_assets/      # Project assets
└── replit.md            # Project context
```

### Next Steps After Publishing

1. Share repository with your team
2. Set up continuous integration (GitHub Actions)

4. Add comprehensive testing suite
5. Set up monitoring and analytics
