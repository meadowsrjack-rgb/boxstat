🧠 Replit Prompt — Full Registration Flow + Unified Account System

Replace the current registration, “Create Player Profile,” and profile-selection pages with a new SportsEngine-style registration flow.
After completion, users land on a Unified Account Page that contains payments, messages, settings, and clickable player cards.
All registration data must automatically push to the local database (Users table) managed by the Admin Profile.
The admin will later assign each player to a team.

⸻

🔹 1. Registration Flow Overview

Step 1 — Registration Intent

Ask:

“Who are you registering for today?”
▢ Myself
▢ My child or another player

Save the selection as registrationType.

⸻

Step 2 — User & Player Information

If “Myself”:
Show a Player Information Form
	•	First Name, Last Name
	•	Email
	•	Phone (optional)
	•	Birthdate (optional)
	•	Gender (optional)

If “My child or another player”:
	1.	Parent/Guardian Form

	•	Birthdate (optional)
	2.	Player Form
	•	First Name, Last Name
	•	Birthdate (optional)
	•	Gender (optional)
	•	“+ Add Another Player” button to register multiple players under the same account

⸻

Step 3 — Program / Package Selection

Add a Payment & Program Selection section before account creation.
	•	Display available packages/programs (fetched or placeholder list) created by the Admin Profile.
Example:
	•	“Elite Training – $149/month”
	•	“Development Program – $99/month”
	•	“Tournament Prep – $59/week”
	•	Users must choose one package per player or one package for the account depending on the flow.
	•	Include a note:
“Payment processing will be completed once packages are finalized.”
	•	Create a placeholder for future Stripe/webhook integration.
(No live payment yet; just store the selected package ID or name.)

⸻

Step 4 — Review & Confirm

Display a summary of:
	•	Account information
	•	Player information
	•	Selected package(s)

Include Edit and Continue buttons.

⸻

Step 5 — Create Account

Prompt for:
	•	Password (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase + number/symbol)
	•	Terms of Service / Privacy checkbox
	•	Marketing opt-in (optional)
Button: Create Account

After submission:
	•	Validate input
	•	Save account and player records to the local database (Users table).
	•	Link any selected package IDs to the account or player records.
	•	Flag these entries as “pending team assignment” for the admin to review and assign teams.

⸻

Step 6 — Email Verification

Show message:

“A verification link has been sent to your email. Please verify to continue.”

After verification, redirect user to the Unified Account Page.

⸻

🔹 2. Unified Account Page (Post-Registration Landing)

This replaces both the old player-profile creation and profile-selection pages.

Header / Top Section
	•	Welcome, [Account Holder Name]!
	•	Payment Summary (next due date, status – placeholder until Stripe integration)
	•	Notifications / Messages
	•	Upcoming Events or Calendar Preview

Navigation Tabs
	•	Home (default dashboard)
	•	Payments
	•	Messages
	•	Settings

Player Cards Section
	•	Show all linked player profiles as clickable cards:
	•	Player photo or initials
	•	Player name + team (if assigned)
	•	Program / Package selected
	•	Upcoming event summary
	•	Add “+ Add Another Player” button for future registrations.
	•	When a card is clicked → open that player’s existing Player Dashboard (stats, trophies, achievements, etc.).
	•	Include a “Back to Account” button within each player dashboard.

⸻

🔹 3. Database Integration Requirements

Once account creation completes:
	•	Write all user and player data to the local database.
	•	Target table: Users (or appropriate user entity table).
	•	Each record should contain:
	•	account_id
	•	registrationType
	•	account_holder_name
	•	email
	•	phone
	•	package_selected (placeholder value)
	•	player_profiles[] (array of linked player objects)
	•	status (e.g., “pending team assignment”)
	•	The Admin Profile can view these new entries and manually assign teams.

⸻

🔹 4. Logic & Behavior

Condition	Behavior
registrationType == "myself"	Create single player profile linked directly to account ID.
registrationType == "my child"	Create parent account and link one or more player profiles.
After verification	Redirect to Unified Account Page with dynamic data display.


⸻

🔹 5. UI / UX Notes
	•	Clean, mobile-first design mirroring SportsEngine simplicity.
	•	Remove or disable legacy Create Player Profile and Profile Selection components.
	•	Use conditional rendering to show only relevant fields per registration type.
	•	Ensure navigation is smooth and cached locally.
	•	Keep placeholders for future Stripe checkout and webhook connections.

⸻

🔹 6. Future-Proof Extensions
	•	Enable secondary guardian invites.
	•	Connect Stripe webhooks to update payment status and package billing automatically.
	•	Add admin function for bulk team assignment and program tracking.
	•	Introduce coach / tournament dashboards using same data structure.

⸻

✅ Expected Outcome
	1.	The old registration and profile pages are removed.
	2.	Users see a SportsEngine-style question (“Myself” or “My child”).
	3.	They complete forms → select a program/package → create account.
	4.	Their information (auto-pushed to local Users table) awaits admin team assignment.
	5.	After email verification, they land on the Unified Account Page, which shows:
	•	“Welcome, [Account Holder Name]”
	•	Payments, Messages, Settings
	•	Clickable Player Cards linked to their dashboards
	•	Placeholder for Stripe payment integration.
