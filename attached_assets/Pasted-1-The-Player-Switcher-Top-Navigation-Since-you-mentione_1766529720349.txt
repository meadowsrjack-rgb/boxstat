1. The "Player Switcher" (Top Navigation)

Since you mentioned accessing programs by clicking on the player, place a horizontal Player Carousel at the very top.

How it works: Icons with the player's name (e.g., "Jack Jr.", "Alex").

The Benefit: When a parent taps a player, the store filters to show only what is relevant to them (e.g., "U12 Jerseys" or "Advanced Skills Academy").

2. Category-Based Storefront

Instead of a "Make a Payment" button that opens a generic dropdown, use visual Category Tiles. This makes the app feel like a premium academy.

Category	Item Types
Club & Subscriptions	Youth Club, monthly dues, recurring memberships.
Training & Camps	Private 10-packs, single sessions, summer camps.
Gear & Apparel	Jerseys, shooting shirts, water bottles.
Digital Academy	Online training programs (accessible in-app).
3. "My Active Programs" (The Management Piece)

Keep the "Active Subscriptions" section, but move it below the store or into a "Manage" toggle.

Current UI Fix: Instead of a long list of "test sub" boxes, use a summary card for each player.

Example: A card for "Jack Player" that, when tapped, expands to show his active Youth Club sub, his remaining 4/10 private training sessions, and his jersey order status.

Specific Recommendations for your Items:

Private Training (10-packs): Use a "Punch Card" visual. Parents love seeing "6 sessions left" rather than just a "Completed" payment receipt.

Jerseys: Include a "Size Guide" link directly in the product view to reduce friction.

Online Programs: Since these are accessible in-app, add a "Start Training" button directly on the receipt/subscription card once they buy it, so they don't have to hunt for the content.

Pro Tip: Change the button text from "Make a Payment" to "Browse Programs & Gear." It shifts the psychology from "I'm losing money" to "I'm investing in my kid's hobby."
