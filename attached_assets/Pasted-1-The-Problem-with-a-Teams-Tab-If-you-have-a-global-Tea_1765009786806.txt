1. The Problem with a "Teams" Tab

If you have a global "Teams" tab, it confuses the users who are in programs that don't look like teams.

Youth Club clearly has teams like "10u Black" and "12u Red".

Skills Academy has skill levels like "Rookies" or "Elite".

Private Training likely has no teams at all.

If a user in "Private Training" clicks a "Teams" tab, they will see an empty screen or irrelevant lists of 10u teams.

2. The Smarter Solution: "Parent & Child"

Keep Programs as your main tab. Think of "Teams" and "Groups" as children of those programs. They are technically the same thing: Sub-Groups.

Parent: Program (e.g., Youth Club) → Child: Team (e.g., 10u Black)

Parent: Program (e.g., Skills Academy) → Child: Group (e.g., Rookies)

3. How to display it in the App (Dynamic Labels)

In your database, you can call them all Groups or Cohorts. But in the App UI, change the label based on the Program Type:

If user clicks "Youth Club": Title the list "Select your Team".

List: 10u Black, 12u Red, etc.

If user clicks "Skills Academy": Title the list "Select your Level".

List: Rookies, Intermediate, Elite.

If user clicks "Private Training": Skip the list entirely. Go straight to booking coaches.

Summary

Don't make "Teams" a top-level tab next to "Programs." Do make "Teams" a step inside the "Youth Club" program page.

How to handle "Multiple Teams" (The Logic)

A player might be in the 10u Black team (Club) AND the Rookies group (Skills Academy). You don't want "Rookies" to look like a "Team" with a roster.

You need a "Social Toggle" in your database for each Program.

Program: Youth Club

Has Teams? YES

Show Roster? YES

Enable Chat? YES

Result: Player sees "10u Black" badge, Roster button, and Chat button.

Program: Skills Academy

Has Teams? NO (It has levels)

Show Roster? NO (Privacy—don't show random classmates)

Enable Chat? MAYBE (Or restricted to Coach Announcements only)

Result: Player sees "Rookies" badge, but no Roster button.

make sure this is reflected in player dashboard
