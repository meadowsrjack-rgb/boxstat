🧮 How It Works After Creation

Once a package is created:

It appears in the Packages List (Admin > Packages) with key details:
Name | Type | Billing | Coverage | Active | Linked Stripe ID

When purchased, the system:

Adds an entry in user_subscriptions

Automatically checks coverage type:

If family, marks all child players of that parent active

If per-player, only the selected player gets access

If it expires, flags the player(s) or family as inactive

Automation Enhancements

Add checkbox → Sync to Stripe
→ automatically create product + price via Stripe API

Add webhook handler to update status when payments succeed/expire
