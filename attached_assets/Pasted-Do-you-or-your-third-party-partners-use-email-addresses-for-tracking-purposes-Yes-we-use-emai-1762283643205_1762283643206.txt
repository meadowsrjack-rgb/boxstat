Do you or your third-party partners use email addresses for tracking purposes?


Yes, we use email addresses for tracking purposes

No, we do not use email addresses for tracking purposes

Definitions and Examples

Tracking
Tracking is linking data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device such as a user ID, device ID, or profile, with Third-Party Data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. It also refers to sharing data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device with a data broker.

Tracking does not apply in the following situations:

When the data is linked solely on the end-user's device and is not sent off the device in a way that can identify the end-user or device
When the data broker uses the data shared with them solely for fraud detection or prevention or security purposes
When the data broker is a consumer reporting agency and the data is shared with them for purposes of (1) reporting on a consumer’s creditworthiness, or (2) obtaining information on a consumer’s creditworthiness for the specific purpose of making a credit determination.
Third-Party Data
Third-Party Data is any data about a particular end-user or device collected from the apps, websites, or offline properties not owned by the developer.

Examples
To help put tracking into context, here are a few examples:

Displaying targeted advertisements in your app based on user data collected from apps and websites owned by other companies
Sharing device location data or email lists with a data broker
Sharing a list of emails, advertising IDs, or other IDs with a third-party advertising network that uses that information to retarget those users in other developers' apps or to find similar users
Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers' apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency, even if you don't use the SDK for these purposes. For example, using a login SDK that repurposes the data it collects from your app to enable targeted advertising in other developers' apps.
