Feature Addition: Purchaseable Online Training Programs (Subscription Model)

Develop a new, premium section within the app for purchaseable online training programs. This feature should be seamlessly integrated into the parent's user experience.

Program Showcase:

Create a dedicated "Training" or "UYP Academy" tab in the app.

This section will display available online training programs (e.g., "Elite Ball Handling," "Advanced Shooting Techniques," "Vertical Jump Program").

Each program listing should include a detailed description, a short, free preview video, and clear subscription pricing (e.g., monthly and annual options).

Payment Integration with SportsEngine:

All subscription purchases must be processed through the SportsEngine Payment API.

When a parent selects "Subscribe," the app must initiate a secure transaction flow with SportsEngine.

Upon successful payment confirmation from the API, the app must unlock the corresponding training content for that user's account (and any linked player accounts, if applicable).

The system must manage subscription status (Active, Canceled, Expired) based on webhook notifications or API calls to SportsEngine.

Video Hosting & Secure Delivery:

Training program videos must be hosted on a professional video platform to ensure security and high-quality streaming. Do not store video files directly on the app's primary server.

Primary Suggestion: Vimeo Pro/Premium. Use the Vimeo API to pull and display videos within the app. This provides robust security (domain-level privacy, no downloads), a high-quality player, and reliable streaming.

Alternative Suggestion: Amazon S3 with CloudFront. For a more custom solution, host video files in an AWS S3 bucket and use the CloudFront CDN for fast, secure delivery. This requires more setup but offers immense scalability.

Videos must be accessible only to users with an active subscription to that specific program.

In-App User Experience:

Once subscribed, users will have a "My Training Library" section.

Videos within the library should be organized into logical chapters or modules.

Include a feature to track progress (e.g., mark videos as "complete").

2. Feature Refinement: Dedicated Check-In Section

On the Player's app home screen, there must be a clearly labeled and prominent section or button named "Check-In".

The sole function of this button is to immediately pull up the player's unique QR code on a bright, full-screen display.

This screen is for the explicit purpose of being scanned by UYP staff at the front door of Momentous Sports Center to log attendance.

3. Feature Refinement: "My Profile" Navigation

The user's personal image (profile picture or default avatar), located in the app's header or main navigation menu, must be a clickable element.

Tapping this image will navigate the user to a comprehensive "My Profile" screen.

This screen will contain all relevant account information:

For Parents: View/edit contact information, manage linked player accounts, view payment history, and manage training subscriptions.

For Players: View their stats, achievements/badges, and basic profile info.
