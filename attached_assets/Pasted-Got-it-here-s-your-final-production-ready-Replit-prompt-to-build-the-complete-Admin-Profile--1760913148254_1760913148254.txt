Got it 👍 — here’s your final, production-ready Replit prompt to build the complete Admin Profile + Dashboard plus Parent Payments tab integration.
It’s written to give Replit full context of your UYP app’s structure and functionality, ensuring all logic, permissions, and UI are properly connected.

🧩 Prompt for Replit — Build Admin Profile & Dashboard (UYP App)

Objective:
Expand the existing UYP Basketball app (built on Next.js/Drizzle/TypeScript in Replit) to include a new Admin Profile—visible only to meadowsrjack@gmail.com—with a comprehensive Admin Dashboard.
Enhance the Parent Payments tab to display player enrollments, registration status, and program payment buttons linked to the correct SportsEngine registration forms.

⚙️ 1️⃣ Admin Profile Setup
Requirements

Add a new profile type: Admin

Appears in Profile Selection Page only if the logged-in user email = meadowsrjack@gmail.com

Uses a distinct Admin color theme and icon

Redirects to /admin-dashboard on selection

Should include navigation tabs as described below

🧭 2️⃣ Admin Dashboard Navigation Structure
Tabs:

Teams Management

Awards & Skills

Registrations

Calendar

Payments

Programs & Training Access

Communications

Each tab should be componentized under /pages/admin/ and use shadcn-ui or equivalent layout.

🧱 3️⃣ Functional Requirements
🧩 Teams Management

Create, rename, and delete teams

Add or remove coaches and players from rosters

Sync with existing teams, users, and profiles tables

Show team cards: team name, level, and roster preview

📝 Registrations

📅 Calendar Management

Create, edit, delete, or move events

Assign events to specific profile types or teams (so only relevant users see them)

Event assignment options:

Leadership, Coaches, Parents, Players, or a specific team/program tag

Hidden events remain invisible to profiles not assigned

💳 Payments Tab (Admin View)

Display all parents and their linked player profiles

Admin can manually:

Set what package they’re paying for

Change status: Paid / Pending / Overdue (auto-color red when overdue)

Link to the same SportsEngine registration forms

Option to mark “Payment Verified” when confirmed via Stripe

🏋️ Training Access

Unlock or restrict access to training programs for players

Toggle program access flags (e.g., “Unlocked”, “Restricted”)

Sync with player dashboard so newly unlocked programs appear automatically

Specific programs

Choose channel (in-app + email notification)

Visual Indicators

✅ Green = Active / Paid

🟡 Yellow = Upcoming Due

🔴 Red = Overdue / Unpaid

Include “Pay Now” button → opens registration link in new tab

🧠 5️⃣ Database & Backend Logic
Tables to Extend

users → add role: 'admin' and restrict admin access to meadowsrjack@gmail.com

teams → add foreign keys for coaches & players

events → add visibleTo: string[] (list of roles/teamIds)

payments → store parentId, playerId, programId, plan, dueDate, status, link

announcements → add targetType (all, team, program, role)

🎨 6️⃣ UI / UX Suggestions

Use the same top-nav layout as the coach dashboard for consistency.

Add an Admin Menu with icons for each tab (Team, Calendar, Payments, etc.).

Use color-coded badges for player statuses (green, yellow, red).

Add filter dropdowns (Program / Team / Payment status) for quick searching.

Include modal confirmations for destructive actions (delete team, reset awards).

Add toast notifications for successful updates (e.g., “Payment status updated”, “Team created”).

🚀 7️⃣ Additional Features Recommended for Admin

Audit Logs
Track all admin actions (e.g., “Edited player skills”, “Deleted event”) for accountability.

Export Reports
Export rosters, attendance, payments, or awards as CSV.

Analytics Summary Tab
Display total active players, overdue payments, and event counts.

Impersonate View (Read-Only)
Allow admin to view any parent or coach dashboard without editing rights.

Push Notifications Integration
Send announcements via email or in-app to selected roles (Coaches, Parents, etc.).

Program Editor
Add new UYP programs or update pricing and registration links directly.

✅ 8️⃣ Access Control

Restrict all admin routes under /admin/** to authenticated users with role = 'admin' and email = 'meadowsrjack@gmail.com'.

Deny direct navigation for unauthorized users.

Example Next.js middleware:

export async function middleware(req) {
  const session = await getSession(req);
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin') && session?.user?.email !== 'meadowsrjack@gmail.com') {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/');
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

🧩 9️⃣ Deployment

Ensure Admin features integrate seamlessly with the existing parent/coach/player dashboards.

All data updates (teams, payments, events) should sync in real-time with the connected Firestore or Drizzle database.

Verify role-based visibility for events and announcements.

A dedicated Admin Profile (for meadowsrjack@gmail.com)

Comprehensive Dashboard tabs for teams, awards, skills, calendar, payments, and communication
