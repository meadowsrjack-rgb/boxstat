Project Fix Request: “Create Profile” button not working

Context
On the “Create Player Profile” page (UI shows fields: First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Team, Jersey Number, Position, School Grade, Address), the red Create Profile button does nothing when clicked.

What I need

Find the component that renders the form (likely CreatePlayerProfile.jsx/tsx or similar) and the button with text “Create Profile”.

Make the button submit the form and call an async createPlayerProfile function.

Add basic validation and show user feedback.

Implementation details

Ensure there is a <form> around the fields and the button has type="submit".

Add onSubmit={handleSubmit} on the form. In handleSubmit:

event.preventDefault()

Build a payload from controlled inputs:
{ firstName, lastName, phone, team, jerseyNumber, position, grade, address }

Validate: required → firstName, lastName, phone, team, position; phone = 10–15 digits.

Show inline errors under each invalid field.

Set a loading state; disable the button while loading.

await fetch('/api/players', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify(payload) })

If 200/201 → show success toast “Profile created”, then navigate to the roster/list page.

If error → show error toast/message.

If there is no backend route yet, add a simple Express (or Next.js API route) handler:

POST /api/players → validate body, return 201 with {id: ...}.

Make sure the button is not disabled by default and not wrapped in a disabled parent.

Remove any e.stopPropagation() / pointer-events: none CSS that could block clicks.

Acceptance criteria

Clicking Create Profile with valid inputs sends a POST to /api/players and navigates on success.

With invalid inputs, the form prevents submit and shows clear error messages.

The button shows a loading state (e.g., spinner/text) and is disabled during the request.

Errors from the API display a readable message.

Works in the Replit preview and when opened in a new tab.

Nice to have (if quick)

Input masks: phone auto-formats to digits only.

Persist draft values in state so users don’t lose what they typed on validation errors.

Add simple unit test for handleSubmit happy path and validation.
