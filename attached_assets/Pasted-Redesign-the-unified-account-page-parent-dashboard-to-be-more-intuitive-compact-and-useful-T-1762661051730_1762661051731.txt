Redesign the unified account page (parent dashboard) to be more intuitive, compact, and useful.

The Home tab should be upgraded to include:

Action Required Panel (registration due, payments due, pending waivers, inactive status, etc.)

My Players section with compact player cards, status bars, and quick actions

Upcoming Events preview (with link to full calendar)

Announcements / Team Messages preview section (must use existing announcement + notification architecture)

Quick links (Add Player, Register, Payments, etc.)

Do NOT hardcode announcements or events — use the existing live data the app already pulls from admin-created items.

✅ Requirements for layout changes
1. Action Required Panel

Add a horizontal alert panel at the top that shows:

registration needed

payment due

inactive players

missing documents/waivers

Make this render only if data exists.

2. Player Cards (compact redesign)

Each player tile should become smaller and include:

player name and team

status (Active/Inactive/Payment Due)

next event

skills % and awards

quick buttons (“View”, “Register”, “Pay Now”, etc.)

Must NOT break existing player routing or components.

3. Upcoming Events Section

A short list (3–5 items):

practice / game

date/time/location

supports multiple players

Must use existing event data logic.

4. Announcements / Messages Preview

Use the current admin-created announcements and messages system.
Display the latest 3–5 announcements with a “View All” link.

5. Quick Links

Small button row:

Add Player

Payments

Registration

Calendar

Hook to existing routes.

✅ Tabs Structure (do not break routing)

Keep the existing tabs, but ensure “Home” becomes a true dashboard:

Home (overview)

Players

Payments

Messages

Settings

Events (if already exists)

✅ Styling Guidelines

Keep design consistent with your existing components (Tailwind, icons, etc.)

Keep mobile responsiveness

Maintain your theme and spacing scale

Avoid introducing new dependencies unless necessary

✅ Implementation Notes

Only rewrite the unified account page component and any small subcomponents you introduce (e.g., PlayerCardCompact, ActionRequiredBar).

Do NOT refactor unrelated code.

Do NOT change backend API endpoints.

All existing features must continue functioning with no regressions.

Place new components in the same structure you’re currently using unless clearly beneficial.

Deliverables:

Updated unified account page code

Any new small components used (cards, alert bar, event preview, announcement preview)
