Thanks — this is a *very clear clue trail*, and it tells us a few distinct things. Let’s break it down carefully so you know exactly **why** this is happening and how to fix it.

## 🧩 What’s Really Going On

The errors you’re seeing fall into **three separate but related categories**:

### 1️⃣ “Location not specified. Google Maps API Key status: CONFIGURED.”

➡️ Your app code is checking if there’s an **event location** (address or coordinates) passed into the map component, and there isn’t.
So Google Maps *is configured*, but you’re trying to render a map **with no valid lat/lng or address**.

**In other words:**
The problem is **not your API key**, it’s the **data**.
The map component can’t find a location value for that event — likely because the event’s location field is empty, undefined, or not being passed through from your database or event form.

---

### 2️⃣ “gen_204 net::ERR_FAILED”

This is that harmless **CSP test ping** from Google Maps (`gen_204?csp_test=true`).
It’s not the cause of the map not rendering — it’s just Google Maps checking browser security.
You can safely ignore it if your map loads later.

✅ This message does *not* break your map.
🚫 It can be safely ignored.

### 3️⃣ “Could not find internal input field in autocomplete element after 3 seconds”

That one comes from `GooglePlacesAutocomplete` — it’s saying your Places Autocomplete component mounted but couldn’t find the input element it was supposed to attach to.
That typically happens if:

* The Autocomplete is rendered inside a **hidden modal/tab** (e.g., your event dialog from `@radix-ui/react-dialog`), **before** it’s visible.
* The DOM input ref wasn’t attached yet when the script initialized.

## 🛠️ How to Fix

### ✅ **Fix 1: Ensure Event Has Location Data**

In your event creation or edit form, make sure you’re actually saving the location to your event object like:

```ts
{
  id: "123",
  title: "Youth Practice",
  startTime: "2025-11-02T18:00:00",
  location: "123 Main St, Irvine, CA 92618", // or lat/lng
}
```

Then, in your event pop-up:

```tsx
{event.location ? (
  <GoogleMapComponent address={event.location} />
) : (
  <p className="text-muted-foreground">Location not specified</p>
)}
```

If you’re using a Places Autocomplete input, confirm that `onPlaceSelected` updates your event’s location field properly.

---

### ✅ **Fix 2: Delay Autocomplete Until Modal Is Open**

If your map or autocomplete lives inside a `Radix <Dialog>`, you can guard it like this:

```tsx
const [dialogOpen, setDialogOpen] = useState(false);

<Dialog open={dialogOpen} onOpenChange={setDialogOpen}>
  <DialogContent>
    {dialogOpen && (
      <GooglePlacesAutocomplete
        apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY}
        selectProps={{
          onChange: (place) => console.log(place),
        }}
      />
    )}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

This prevents the Autocomplete from mounting before the DOM input is visible.

---

### ✅ **Fix 3: Add Fallback for Missing Locations**

In your event modal, show a friendly message or placeholder map when `event.location` is empty:

```tsx
{!event.location && (
  <div className="bg-muted text-muted-foreground rounded-md p-4 text-center">
    Location not specified.
  </div>
)}
```

That way, you won’t get “Location not specified” or undefined errors.

---

### ✅ **Fix 4: If Using Lat/Lng Instead of Address**

Double-check that your location data matches what your map component expects:

```tsx
<GoogleMap
  center={{
    lat: Number(event.lat) || 33.6846,
    lng: Number(event.lng) || -117.8265,
  }}
  zoom={13}
  mapContainerClassName="w-full h-64 rounded-md"
/>
```

## 🚀 TL;DR — What You Should Do

1. **Check your event data** — does each event in your database actually have a `location` or `coordinates` field populated?

   * If not, update your event creation form to save it.

2. **Render map conditionally** only when a valid location exists.

3. **Delay Autocomplete mounting** until the modal is visible.

4. **Ignore the “gen_204” warning** — it’s not fatal.

If you show me the portion of your **event modal code** (where you’re trying to show the Google map and location), I can pinpoint *exactly* where it’s failing and give you a corrected JSX snippet for it.

Would you like to paste that `EventDetailModal` or `EventPopup` component here?
