The issue lies in the CSS logic used for .scrollable-page.

The Root Cause: You are using min-height: 100dvh in your CSS.

How min-height works: It allows the container to grow to fit the content. If your content is 2000px tall, the container becomes 2000px tall.

The Scroll Logic: For overflow-y: auto to work, the container must be shorter than the content inside it. Because your container is growing to match the content size, it thinks it doesn't need to scroll.

Why it freezes: The body likely has overflow: hidden (to prevent the white gap/bounce), so the body clips your 2000px container, and the container itself has no reason to scroll internally.

The Fix: You must switch from min-height to a fixed height so the container is forced to be the size of the screen, causing the content inside to overflow and trigger the scroll.

Here is the fix applied directly to your player-dashboard.tsx file.

Step 1: Update the Return Statement

Locate the main return ( statement (around line 893) and replace the opening div. We will use Tailwind classes to force the height and overflow behavior, overriding the faulty .scrollable-page class.

Change this:

TypeScript
return (
  <div className="scrollable-page bg-gray-50 safe-bottom">
To this:

TypeScript
return (
  // h-[100dvh] restricts height to screen size.
  // overflow-y-auto allows internal scrolling.
  // overscroll-contain prevents the whole page from bouncing (rubber-banding).
  <div className="h-[100dvh] w-full overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden bg-gray-50 safe-bottom overscroll-contain">
Step 2: (Optional) Fix the Header

Currently, your header is inside the scrollable area, meaning it will scroll off the screen when the user scrolls down. In native apps, the header usually stays at the top.

If you want the header to stick to the top, add sticky top-0 z-50 to the header tag (around line 895):

TypeScript
<header className="bg-white shadow-sm safe-top sticky top-0 z-50">
Step 3: Explanation of the changes

h-[100dvh]: This forces the dashboard container to be exactly the height of the mobile viewport. It stops the div from growing larger than the screen.

overflow-y-auto: Since the content is now taller than the container (because we fixed the container height), this forces the browser to create a scroll area.

overscroll-contain: This tells iOS, "If the user scrolls past the edge of this area, do not pass that scroll event to the parent/body." This fixes the "stuck" feeling.
