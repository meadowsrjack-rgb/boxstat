I. MISSION

The club team experience aims to develop student-athletes for high school-level play. The coaching staff focuses on building confidence, work ethic, and character, emphasizing experiences and development over wins and losses.

Players​​will​ ​learn​ ​how​ ​to​ ​compete​ ​at​ ​a​ ​high​ ​level,​ ​prepare​ ​for​​ and​ ​receive​ ​constructive​ ​criticism, play​ ​fundamentally​ ​sound,​ ​be​​ disciplined,​ ​and​ ​work​ ​as​ ​a​ ​team.​ ​Our​ ​primary​ ​objective​ ​is ​​to​ ​foster players​ ​to​ ​be​ ​respectful,​ ​hard-working​ ​student-athletes ​​and help them become​ ​young men & women of character and integrity.

 

II. PARENT EXPECTATIONS AND COMMITMENT

Support:​ ​​Parental​ ​support​​and​ ​involvement​ ​is​ ​essential​ ​to​ ​team​ ​success.​ ​Parents​ ​must​ ​do their best to make sure ​the​ ​player​ ​attends​ ​all​ ​club​ ​and​ ​team​​functions​ ​(practices,​ ​meetings,​ ​games,​ ​special​ ​events). We ​​understand​ ​there​ ​will​ ​be​ ​times​ ​when​ ​scheduling​ ​conflicts​​ cannot​ ​be​ ​avoided.​ ​When​ ​a​ ​player​ ​or parent​ ​has​ ​an​​ unavoidable​ ​conflict,​ ​please communicate to the respective head coach.

Instruction:​ ​​Players​ ​will​ ​only​ ​receive​ ​one​ ​set​ ​of​​ instructions​ ​before,​ ​during,​ ​and​ ​after​ ​practices​ ​or games.​ ​For ​​this​ ​reason,​​ ​the​ ​team’s​ ​head​ ​and​/or​ ​assistant​ ​coach will ​be ​​the​ ​only​ ​voice​ ​at all​ ​games​ ​and​ ​practices.​ ​No​ ​one​ ​other​​than​ ​the​ ​coaches​ ​may​ ​sit​ ​on​ ​or near​ ​the​ ​team​ ​bench​ ​before ​​and​ ​during​ ​games​ ​at​ ​any​ ​times,​ ​including​ ​parents​ ​(no​​ exceptions).
