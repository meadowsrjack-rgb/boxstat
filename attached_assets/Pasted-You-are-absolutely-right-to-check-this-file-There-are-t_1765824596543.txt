You are absolutely right to check this file. There are **two major issues** in your `capacitor.config.ts` that are causing the white gaps and preventing the "Full Bleed" effect on the iPhone 15.

Here is the corrected file and the explanation of why your current settings are fighting your CSS.

### The Fix

```typescript
import type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const isDevMode = process.env.CAPACITOR_MODE !== 'production';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.boxstat.app',
  appName: 'BoxStat',
  webDir: 'dist/public',
  
  // FIX 1: Move backgroundColor to the ROOT level.
  // When inside the 'ios' object, it is often ignored by the WebView itself.
  // This sets the background of the underlying view to black, fixing the "bounce" gap.
  backgroundColor: '#000000', 

  ...(isDevMode ? {} : {
    server: {
      url: 'https://boxstat.app',
      cleartext: false,
    },
  }),

  ios: {
    // FIX 2: Change 'automatic' to 'never'.
    // 'automatic' pushes your app down below the notch (creating a white bar).
    // 'never' allows your app to go BEHIND the notch (Full Bleed), 
    // which allows your CSS 'env(safe-area-inset-top)' to work correctly.
    contentInset: 'never', 
    
    // (You can remove backgroundColor from here since we moved it to root)
  },

  plugins: {
    Keyboard: {
      resize: 'body',
      style: 'DARK',
      resizeOnFullScreen: true,
    },
    SplashScreen: {
      launchShowDuration: 3000,
      autoHide: false,
      backgroundColor: '#000000', 
      showSpinner: true,
      androidSpinnerStyle: 'large',
      spinnerColor: '#d82428',
    },
    Geolocation: {},
    PushNotifications: {
      presentationOptions: ['badge', 'sound', 'alert'],
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

### Why this fixes it:

1.  **`contentInset: 'never'` vs `'automatic'`**:

      * **The Problem:** You are currently using `'automatic'`. On an iPhone 15, this tells iOS, "Please safely push my web content *below* the notch so it doesn't get covered." This creates a permanent gap at the top.
      * **The Solution (`never`):** Since you added `padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top)` in your React code, you are manually handling the notch. You need to tell Capacitor to **stop** handling it for you. `'never'` lets the webview expand to the very top edge of the screen.

2.  **`backgroundColor` Placement**:

      * **The Problem:** You had `backgroundColor` inside the `ios: {}` object. While valid for some native view controller configs, Capacitor primarily looks for `backgroundColor` at the **root** of the config object to set the global WebView background.
      * **The Solution:** Moving it to the root ensures that if the user scrolls past the edge of your app (rubber banding), they see black, not white.

### One Final Check (Status Bar)

If you apply these changes and *still* see a white bar at the top, it means the **Status Bar** plugin is forcing a white background.

If that happens, install the Status Bar plugin:
`npm install @capacitor/status-bar`

And add this to your `plugins` object in the config above:

```typescript
StatusBar: {
  style: 'DARK',
  backgroundColor: '#000000',
  overlaysWebView: true, // This forces the status bar to float ON TOP of your content, not push it down.
},
```
