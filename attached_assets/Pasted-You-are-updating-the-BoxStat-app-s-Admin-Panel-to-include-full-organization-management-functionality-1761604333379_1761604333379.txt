You are updating the BoxStat app’s Admin Panel to include full organization management functionality across all key system tables.

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Enhance the Admin Dashboard to include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the following entities:
Users, Programs, Divisions, Teams, Packages, Awards, Skills, Events, Attendance, Notifications, Transactions, and Settings.

Each section should have:
- A data table view (sortable, searchable)
- A “Create New” button opening a modal form
- Edit and Delete options
- Integration with the backend API and Replit Database or Postgres

- Persist all data to Replit Database (JSON) or Postgres (if configured).
- Confirm deletion with dialog.
- Update admin navbar with all new tabs in this order:
  `Users`, `Programs`, `Divisions`, `Teams`, `Packages`, `Awards`, `Skills`, `Events`, `Attendance`, `Notifications`, `Transactions`, `Settings`.

## ✅ FINAL BEHAVIOR EXPECTATION

  - `PUT /api/[entity]/:id`
  - `DELETE /api/[entity]/:id`
- Auto-refresh tables after create/edit/delete.
- Admin role (meadowsrjack@gmail.com) has full access.
