You are updating the BoxStat app’s event creation system to support scoped visibility and assignment logic.

### Objective
Modify the existing event creation flow (admin dashboard) to include two structured fields:
1. `visibility` — controls who can SEE the event.
2. `assignTo` — controls who PARTICIPATES in or is tracked for the event.

### Requirements

#### 1️⃣ Event Object Structure
Each new event should include the following fields:
{
  id: string,                    // unique event ID
  title: string,
  type: string,                  // practice, game, camp, etc.
  description?: string,
  date: string,
  startTime: string,
  endTime: string,
  location?: string,
  visibility: {
    roles?: string[],            // e.g. ["Player", "Coach", "Parent"]
    teams?: string[],            // e.g. ["Titans", "Wildcats"]
    programs?: string[],         // e.g. ["Skills Academy", "Youth Club"]
    divisions?: string[],        // e.g. ["6th–8th"]
    packages?: string[],         // e.g. ["Monthly Training"]
    organizationId?: string      // org isolation
  },
  assignTo: {
    roles?: string[],            // who can RSVP/check in
    teams?: string[],
    programs?: string[],
    divisions?: string[],
    packages?: string[],
    users?: string[],            // optional direct user assignment (emails or IDs)
  },
  rsvpRequired?: boolean,
  capacity?: number,
  allowCheckIn?: boolean,
  checkInRadius?: number,
  sendNotifications?: boolean,
  createdBy: string,             // admin user ID
  createdAt: string,
  status?: "active" | "cancelled" | "completed" | "draft"
}

#### 2️⃣ Admin Event Creation UI
- Add two new sections to the Create Event modal:

**Visibility**
- Multi-select dropdowns for:
  - Role (Coach, Player, Parent, Admin)
  - Team (populate from `/api/teams`)
  - Program (populate from `/api/programs`)
  - Division (static list)
  - Package (populate from `/api/programs` if applicable)
- Optional toggle: "Visible to entire organization"

**Assign To**
- Same dropdown structure as above, but used for attendance/tracking scope
- Add helper text: “Only assigned users can RSVP, check in, or receive stats for this event.”

#### 3️⃣ Logic
- When the admin saves:
  - Store both objects (`visibility` and `assignTo`) in the database.
  - On the front-end (player/coach/parent dashboards), only show events where the user:
    - Matches at least one `visibility` condition (role, team, program, etc.)
  - Only users in the `assignTo` conditions can RSVP, check in, or be marked present.

#### 4️⃣ Notifications
If `sendNotifications` = true:
- Send push and/or email to all users included in `assignTo`
- Use event title and date in the message

#### 5️⃣ Integration Notes
- The existing `/api/events` endpoint should accept the two new fields.
- Database schema (Replit DB or Postgres) should be updated accordingly.
- If Replit DB: store visibility and assignTo as nested JSON objects.
- If Postgres: create JSONB columns for `visibility` and `assignTo`.

#### 6️⃣ Example Entry
{
  id: "evt_001",
  title: "Skills Academy Training",
  type: "training",
  date: "2025-10-30",
  startTime: "17:00",
  endTime: "19:00",
  visibility: {
    roles: ["Coach", "Player", "Parent"],
    programs: ["Skills Academy"],
    teams: ["Titans", "Wildcats"],
    organizationId: "org_001"
  },
  assignTo: {
    roles: ["Coach", "Player"],
    teams: ["Titans"],
    programs: ["Skills Academy"]
  },
  rsvpRequired: true,
  allowCheckIn: true,
  sendNotifications: true,
  createdBy: "admin_123",
  createdAt: "2025-10-24T17:45:00Z"
}

### End of Prompt
Implement and connect to the admin dashboard’s “Create Event” modal.
Ensure both new sections (Visibility + Assign To) appear above RSVP/Notifications.
