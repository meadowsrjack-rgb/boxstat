here’s a ready-to-use test payload for the Skills Academy form (formId: "lcm8WeBVF7Hqk18Xxmoz") using your parent email ozdunks@gmail.com
. This simulates a successful paid submission so your /api/intake/ghl route can upsert the parent + player, mark the purchase active, and print a magic link to your Replit logs.
