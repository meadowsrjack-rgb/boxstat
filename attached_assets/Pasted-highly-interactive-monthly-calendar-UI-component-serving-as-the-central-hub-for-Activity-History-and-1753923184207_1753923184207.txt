highly interactive monthly calendar UI component serving as the central hub for Activity History and Event Management. It provides a clear, at-a-glance view of a player's schedule and past participation. Users can fluidly navigate between months using the intuitive left and right chevron arrows flanking the centered month name. Each numbered circle representing a day is interactive, allowing players to tap for detailed activity information.

Enhanced Interactive Design & Event Status Indicators:



Overall Aesthetic: Maintains a clean, minimalist, and monochromatic design, primarily using black and white/grayscale for its base, but with strategic use of color and iconography to convey event status.

Upcoming Events & Practices:

Days with upcoming events (practices, games, etc.) are visually distinct. Their circular containers might feature a bold border in a UYP brand color (e.g., vibrant orange or blue) or a subtle, colored dot/icon (like a small basketball) placed within or directly below the day number. The day number itself could be bolded or in a primary color to draw attention.

Past Events:

Days with past events will typically maintain the calendar's default grayscale appearance for their numbered circles, indicating they've occurred but are no longer active.

Completed Events (QR Code Check-in Status): This is where the interactive power truly shines.

Days where an event was successfully completed via QR code check-in are clearly marked. The day's circular container might change to a solid fill of a specific "completed" color (e.g., a bright green or the UYP brand color), and a prominent checkmark icon is displayed within the circle, indicating successful participation and attendance.

Days where an event was missed or not checked in for would stand out from completed days. They could retain the default grayscale circle with perhaps a subtle 'X' icon or remain in a less emphasized state compared to completed days, allowing coaches and players to quickly identify missed sessions.

Header & Navigation: The "Activity History" title and "View all" link (with chevron) provide quick access to overarching history lists, while month navigation arrows ensure easy chronological Browse.

This design allows players, parents and coaches to quickly scan the calendar and understand not just when events are scheduled, but also what has been completed, making the QR code check-in system an integral and visible part of their progress tracking. keep it in the same style as the current dashboard, minimalist, sleek.
