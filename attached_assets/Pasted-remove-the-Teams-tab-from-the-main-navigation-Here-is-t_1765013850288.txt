remove the "Teams" tab from the main navigation.

Here is the best-practice architecture for Admin Dashboard:

1. The New Hierarchy (Clean & Logical)

Instead of two separate tabs, you merge them into one "Programs" hub.

Tab: Programs (Main View)

Click: "Youth Club" (Drill down)

Sub-Tab A: Overview (Description, Dates, Cover Photo)

Sub-Tab B: Teams/Groups (Create "10u Black", Manage Rosters here)

Sub-Tab C: Product Settings (Price, Subscription rules)

2. How to Handle "Program = Product"

Since every program is something you sell, you shouldn't split the "Money" logic from the "Basketball" logic. Keep them together in the Product Settings sub-tab mentioned above.

Inside the "Youth Club" program dashboard, you would have a settings panel like this:

Pricing Model: [ Dropdown: Subscription / One-Time ]

Price: $150

Billing Frequency: Monthly

Sku/Stripe ID: youth_club_monthly

This is the standard "LMS" (Learning Management System) pattern used by platforms like Teachable or Kajabi: The Course is the Product.

3. The Risk: "Where is Johnny?"

The only downside to removing the global "Teams" tab is that it becomes harder to find a specific player if you don't know which team they are on.

The Solution: Add a global "All Players" or "Directory" tab.

This is just a master list of every human in your system.

You search "Johnny", click his name, and his profile tells you: "Active in Youth Club (10u Black)".

Summary Checklist for your Dev:

[ ] Delete Teams from the left sidebar.

[ ] Add a Teams & Rosters tab inside the generic "Program Details" view.

[ ] Add a Pricing tab inside the "Program Details" view to manage the subscription settings.

[ ] Ensure the global search bar can find a player and link you directly to their team roster.



Do not delete the Products tab.

You are confusing Services (Programs) with Goods (Uniforms). They behave differently in your database, so they need separate homes in your Admin Dashboard.

The Fix: Rename "Products" to "Store"

Since you sell physical items (Uniforms) that don't have rosters or schedules, you need a dedicated place for them.

1. The "Programs" Tab (Services)

What lives here: Club Membership, Skills Academy, Training Packs.

Key Data: Rosters, Schedules, Recurring Billing, Attendance.

Logic: "People paying for Access."

2. The "Store" Tab (Goods)

What lives here: Uniforms, Hoodies, Water Bottles, Equipment.

Key Data: Inventory (Sizes S/M/L), Shipping/Pickup status, One-time cost.

Logic: "People paying for Things."

How to link them (The "Required" Logic)

The reason you felt they were related is that a player needs a uniform to be in the program. You should handle this with a dependency, not by merging the tabs.

In your "Program Settings" (inside the Programs tab): Add a field called "Required Gear".

Select Product: [Dropdown pulls from Store tab] → "Official Team Uniform 2025"

Action: When a parent registers for the "Youth Club" program, the app automatically adds the "Official Team Uniform" to their cart before checkout.
